# LTC2344-16-Controller
LTC2344-16/18 Quad Differential ADC controller

Verilog code for controlling the LTC2344-16 or LTC2344-18 in CMOS mode with an FPGA. 

WARNING: The testbench does NOT model the LTC2344 that well. I created it just to test how my state machine was working with a variable busy signal.
